# Project Ideas & Implementations

## Web Applications

### Interactive Data Visualization Dashboard
**Quick Setup:**
- Use a small dataset (e.g., weather, COVID-19 stats, or finance data).
- Build a Flask app that serves static visualizations using Matplotlib or Plotly.

**Scalable Features:**
- Dynamic filtering (e.g., by date range or location).
- Store user data and custom filters in SQLite.
- Schedule automatic dataset updates (e.g., fetch from an API).


### Core Features
1. **Flask Backend** that serves interactive Plotly visualizations
2. **SQLite Database** for user data and custom filters
3. **Automatic Data Updates** using a background scheduler

### Visualization Components
- Line charts for COVID-19 cases and deaths over time
- Pie chart showing distribution by country
- Data summary panel with key statistics

### Interactive Elements
- Date range filtering
- Country/location filtering 
- Save and load custom filters
- Responsive design that works on various screen sizes

### How to Run the Project

1. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install flask pandas plotly requests apscheduler
```

2. Save the two files I provided:
   - `app.py` - The main Flask application
   - `templates/index.html` - The dashboard template

3. Create a `templates` folder and place the HTML file inside it

4. Run the application:
```
python app.py
```

5. Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:5000`

### Customization Options

- **Different Dataset**: You can easily modify the `get_initial_data()` and `update_data()` functions to use any dataset
- **Additional Visualizations**: The structure makes it easy to add more charts
- **Authentication**: In a production setting, you'd want to add proper user authentication
